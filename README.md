> Leveraging Reinforcement Learning to optimize autonomous mining truck routes for efficient material transportation.

## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize autonomous haulage truck routes in mining operations. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the system learns to navigate efficiently between pickup and dump points while considering time and resource constraints.

## üéØ Features

- **Custom OpenAI Gym Environment**: Simulated mine layout with configurable grid size
- **Intelligent Route Planning**: Autonomous pathfinding between pickup and dump points
- **Realistic Reward System**: Carefully crafted rewards to encourage optimal behavior
- **PPO Implementation**: Utilizing Stable-Baselines3 for robust learning
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track and visualize training progress

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Environment Details
```
 P . . . t    Legend:
 . . . . .    P = Pickup Point
 . . . . .    D = Dump Point
 . . . . .    t = Empty Truck
 . . . . D    T = Loaded Truck
```

### Reward Structure
| Action | Reward |
|--------|---------|
| Load Pickup | +10 |
| Successful Dump | +20 |
| Movement | -1 |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrinceAdvance/mining-rl-project.git
cd mining-rl-project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Structure
```
mining_rl_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ haulage_env.py     # OpenAI Gym environment implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_agent.py     # Training script using PPO
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_agent.py      # Model evaluation script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Documentation
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Training the Agent
```bash
python train_agent.py
```
This will initiate the training process for 10,000 timesteps and save the trained model as `haul_truck_ppo.zip`.

### Testing the Model
```bash
python test_agent.py
```
Watch your trained agent navigate the environment and observe its decision-making process.

## üìà Future Roadmap

- [ ] Implement dynamic obstacles and terrain features
- [ ] Add variable elevation and fuel consumption modeling
- [ ] Support for multiple trucks and collision avoidance
- [ ] Integration with real-time mining telemetry data
- [ ] Enhanced visualization and monitoring tools
